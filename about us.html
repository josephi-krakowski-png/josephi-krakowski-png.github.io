  <h2>When making your purchase it is important to remember not all body lights are created equally. When pricing flashing jewelry, make sure you are not comparing apples to oranges. Don't get stuck with inferior products. Some lights have such short threads that you won't be able to turn them off without the cap popping off and the batteries falling out. Others have defects where the threads are too tight to turn on and the batteries are so small they run out in no time. Magic Matt's Brilliant Blinkys only carries the highest quality products. Your satisfaction is guaranteed.</h2>

  <h2>Flashing led jewelry is great for wedding lights, neon party lights, and it makes great rave equipment. With a flashing pin you can have a light flashing on every part of your body. Magic Matt's is the place for wholesale light up body jewelry. Blinkee.com is owned and operated by Matt Jacobs.</h2>
